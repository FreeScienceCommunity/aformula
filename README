AFormula
========

AFormula is a library for dynamically calculating the value of mathematical
formulas, passed in as strings.  It is designed to mirror roughly the API of
the muParser library <http://muparser.sourceforge.net/> as well as offer me
a place to experiment with more advanced formula evaluation techniques such as
JIT-compiling formulas.

Support is included for all the standard arithmetic and comparative operators,
including <=, >=, !=, ==, <, >, +, -, *, /, and ^ (power).  Arbitrary
variables may be defined (as pointers to double-values), and the assignment
operator (=) may be used to assign values to them.  A full suite of builtin
functions is supported, including:

 * Trigonometry (sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan)
 * Hyperbolic trigonometry (sinh, cosh, tanh, asinh, acosh, atanh)
 * Exponentials (log2, log10 [= log], ln, exp, sqrt)
 * Miscellaneous (sign, rint, abs)
 * Logical control (if)

Finally, the constants 'pi' and 'e' are supported.

AFormula is designed to be quite robust to invalid formulas, and is careful to
return appropriate errors when necessary.

Thanks are most obviously due to the author of muParser, Ingo Berg.  Without
muParser having been written, I never would have been able to start on the
project that produced the need for AFormula.  muParser, which is licensed under
